## plans
1. users -> workouts -> their exercises

## Workout schedule:
Day - S, M, T, W, Thu, F, Sat 

some people like to follow splits based on days

Like Sunday is a chest day
Monday - Back/Bicep, 
Tuesday - Legs. Suppose they miss Monday workout,
Then they won't be hitting back/bicep on tuesday. 
They will just hit legs but some people like to follow a cyclic routine. 


## Split schedule example

1. workout day 1 -> ex 
2. workout day 2 -> ex
3. workout day 3 -> ex
4. workout day 4 -> ex
5. workout day 5 -> ex
6. workout day 6 -> ex
7. workout day 7 -> ex
